            <div>GAWD DAMN THIS PASTA probably tastes like mcdonalds sprite and smells majestic!
                This shop"s a quick stop for different coffee drinks, breakfast burritos, breakfast sandwiches. Large parking lot, and there"s an option to either drive through or walk up. You can eat at the patio. The guys working were kind enough to share that there"s the cafe version up the road if we preferred a larger menu with things like avocado toast, but we chose this place as were just stopping off before hiking at Henry Cowell.
                There"s no menu posted, so they basically talk you through the syrup options (hazelnut, vanilla, caramel, toasted marshmallow, peppermint, pumpkin spice, lavender). Husband got an iced toasted marshmallow latte, and I got an iced lavender latte, both are really solid! Not sure if they have non-dairy options, but for sure they have whole or nonfat milk.
